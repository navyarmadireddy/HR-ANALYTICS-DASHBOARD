# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
This repository contains a HR Analytics Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize employee attrition data within a company. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into factors influencing attrition rates and potential areas for intervention to improve employee retention.


## Problem Statement

Employee attrition can have significant impacts on organizational performance, productivity, and morale. High attrition rates not only result in the loss of valuable talent but also incur costs associated with recruitment, training, and productivity loss. The problem statement revolves around understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition and developing strategies to mitigate attrition rates within the organization.

### Objective: 
To Identify key factors influencing employee attrition within the organization. Develop actionable insights to inform retention strategies and reduce attrition rates.

- Step 4 : Clean and Transform the data.

  1 . Check the data type of each column and Convert to required data type if necessary.

  2 . Handling null values - In view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options. From the column quality empty percentage we know if any null values are present. In our dataset there are no null values.

  3 . Handling Duplicates - Check for duplicate record and remove them if necessary, ensure that it wonâ€™t effect the analysis.

  4 . Handling Inconsistent data - Look for variations in categorical data and Standardize them to ensure consistency

  5 . Create a new column named "Attrition_Count" that contains the count of people who have left, represented as 1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No" using Conditional column from Add Column tab.

    Close and apply to apply changes and load the transformed data into Power BI.

- Step 5 : Navigate to Report View and design Visualizations.

  1 . Card visuals were added to the canvas to represent the key performance indicators - count of employees, employees left, attrition rate, average salary, average age, average years worked .

  2 . Created a donut chart to find the attribute by education filed. It is observed that the attrition rates are highest in Life sciences, followed by medical, marketing, technical degree.

  3 . Created a donut chart to assess attrition rates based on work-life balance ratings, revealing a predominant proportion in the moderate balance category (Rating 3, 54%), while drill-down shows varying job satisfaction ratings, with the highest dissatisfaction observed in Rating 1 (28%).

  4 . Created a line chart depicting attrition counts by age and marital status, showing a trend where the attrition count is higher among married individuals, followed by singles and divorced, with a peak observed between the ages of 30 to 40.

  5 . Generated a stacked column chart illustrating attrition counts by percent salary hike, showcasing the highest attrition count for salary hikes between 10 to 15 percent.

  6 . Created a stacked bar chart representing attrition counts by job role, where attrition counts are highest for lab technicians (62), followed by sales executives (57), research scientists (47) and sales representative (33) with other roles having lower attrition counts.

  7 . Created a stacked bar chart displaying attrition status on the x-axis and average years at current company, in current role, and with current manager on the y-axis. Employees experiencing higher attrition rates have lower average years spent in their current company, role, and with their current manager.

  8 . Created Slicers for department and gender category.
